Combine Archive
===============
This provide an experimental implementation of a Java API to the combine archive (<http://co.mbine.org/documents/archive>).

The archive maintains the manifest of the archive and provides access to the metadata file to enable custom annotation
of the archive. It provides basic annotation of the archive including the creation and modification dates of the contents.
This could be extended to include, for example, the date elements were added to the archive etc.

The API is relatively simple to use. There are two examples files in the that show how to create and populate a new archive
and also how to update an existing archive. These are called:

* CreateNewArchiveTest.java
* UpdateArchiveTest.java

Build Instructions

The project is built using Apache Ant and uses Apache Ivy for dependency resolution.

    # create the JARS containing binaries, sources and documentation
    ant jarAll
For a list of all available targets please use `ant -p`.
